## Section Overview
 - Defining the problem of persistent data
 - Key concepts of containers: immutable, ephemeral
 - Data Volumes
 - Bind Mounts
 - LAB

## Containers: immutable & ephemeral (1)
 - Containers are usually **immutable** and **ephemeral** =>
 - **immutable** => Containers do not change (e.g. we usually don't update the binaries included)
 - **ephemeral** => Containers are temporary/disposable (e.g. to use an updated version of the application we delete the old container and we re-create a new one from an updated image)
 - This is not a limitation of the containers but a design goal, a best best practice.

---

## Containers: immutable & ephemeral (2)

- This is the concept of the **immutable infrastructure**, where we do not change the application components once they are running. If an upgrade operation must be performed, then **new** container are re-created.  
- The main benefits of the **immutable infrastructure** are:
    - Reliability
    - Consistency
    - Changes are reproducible

---

## What about unique data?
 - What about the unique data produced by an application? 
    - Databases or
    - Anything else that an application will store to a file
 - The containers should not contain *unique data* mixed with the application binaries. 
    - This is known as **separation of concerns**  
 - Docker provides us with two solutions to preserve *unique data*:
   1. **Data Volumes**
   2. **Bind Mounts**

---

## Data Volumes
 - Volumes are created and **managed** from Docker
 - Volumes are the **preferred** mechanism for persisting data generated by containers. 
 - Volumes contents exist outside the lifecycle of a given container.
 - When a Docker container is destroyed, itâ€™s entire file system is destroyed too. So if we want to keep this data, it is necessary to use Docker volumes.
 - The container sees it like a **local file path.**
 - Docker volumes are attached to containers during a `docker run` command by using the `-v` option. 

---

## Bind Mounts
 - A bind mount is a **file** or **folder** located in the user's workspace.
 - A bind mount is a file or folder available on the Docker host filesystem, mounted into a running container. 
 - The main difference a *bind mount* has from a *volume* is that since it can exist anywhere on the host filesystem, processes outside of Docker can also modify it.
 - Bind mounts have limited functionality compared to volumes.
 - The container sees it like a **local file path.**
 - Docker **bind mount** volumes are attached to containers during a `docker run` command by using the `-v` option.

## Container data  
 - Because we stopped the container or restarted the host, it doesn't mean that the container's file changes are lost
 - Only when we remove the container, the container's data are deleted.
