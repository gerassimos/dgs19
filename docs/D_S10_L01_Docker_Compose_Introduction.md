# Section 10 - Docker Compose
## 1 Docker Compose - Introduction
---

## Docker Compose - Intro (1)
 - Most modern application are made of multiple smaller *services* that interact with each other to form an **application**  
 - Example:
   - front-end (html - javascript)
   - back-end (business logic - Rest endpoints)
   - DB
 - Deploy and manage multiple services (multiple containers) can be difficult. This is where **docker-compose** comes in to play
 - Instead of executing a separate `docker run` commands for each service of the application we can use a single `docker-compose up` command deploy the entire application.  

---

## Overview of Docker Compose (1)
 - There are 2 separate components required to use  **docker-compose**
   1. The **docker-compose.yml** (YAML) file used to define: 
      - **services** 
      - **networks**
      - **volumes**
   2. The CLI tool **docker-compose** used in conjunction with the *yml* file

---

## Overview of Docker Compose (2) 
 - docker-compose is mainly used for local development purposes. 
 - The yml files can be used on a production environment with **Docker Swarm**. 
 - **docker-compose.yml** is the **default** filename but any file name can be used with `docker-compose -f`.

## Docker Compose - Documentation pages
 - [Overview](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
 - [Install](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
 - [Reference](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/)

---

## Docker Compose - Example (1a)
 - Use `docker-compose up` to start the services defined in a **docker-compose.yml** file  
 
```console
version: '3.6'
# same as 
# docker run -p 8080:80 --name nginx nginx:1.19
   
services:
  nginx:
    image:nginx:1.19
    ports:
    - "8080:80"
```
> The [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/gerassimos/dgs19/blob/master/resources/compose-sample-1/docker-compose.yml) of this example is available in the `resources` directory 

---

## Docker Compose - Example (1b)

```console 
# cd resources/compose-sample-1
# docker-compose up

# docker container ls
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE   COMMAND       CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                  NAMES
94bd5ee203f4   nginx   "nginx -gâ€¦"   2 minutes ago   Up 2 minutes   0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp   composesample1_nginx_1

$ docker network ls
NETWORK ID     NAME                     DRIVER    SCOPE
9f7a65b273f0   bridge                   bridge    local
8acc86631a77   composesample1_default   bridge    local
b0897e090893   host                     host      local
3163420f3967   none                     null      local
```

---

## Docker Compose - version
 - The *version* is first top level key attribute of the `docker-compose.yml` file 
 - It ~~is~~ was mandatory and we should normally use the latest version 
 - The *version* value defines the format (basically the API) 
 - More information [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-versioning/) and [here](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/blob/master/spec.md#version-top-level-element)
 

---

## Docker Compose - Example 2 notes 
 - In this example we will see how to use **Docker compose** to replace all the commands used in the [D_S9_L3_Persistent_Data_LAB](https://github.com/gerassimos/dgs19/blob/master/exercises/D_S9_L3_Persistent_Data_LAB.md)

 - The [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/gerassimos/dgs19/blob/master/resources/compose-sample-2/docker-compose.yml) of this example is available in the `resources` directory.

    ```console
    version: '3.6'
    
    services:
      postgres10:
        image: postgres:10
        environment:
          POSTGRES_DB: "db-test1"
          POSTGRES_USER: "db-user1"
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: "db-pw1"
        volumes:
          - ./init.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql:ro
          - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data      
        networks:
          - net-db
    ...
    ```

    ```console
      pgadmin4:
        image: dpage/pgadmin4:4.6
        environment:
          PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL: "pgadmin"
          PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD: "pgadmin"
        networks:
          - net-db
        ports:
          - "8080:80"      
    
    volumes:
      db-data:
    
    networks:
      net-db:
    ```

## Compose file structure (1)
 - The **`<key>: <value>`** format is used to define single components such as  the image name 
```yml
...
    image: postgres:10
...    
``` 

---

## Compose file structure (2)

 - The value of some attributes keys such as the **volumes** and **ports** (note plural) is an array. The " ** - ** " symbol is used to define an element of an array 

```yml
    volumes:
      - ./init.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql:ro
      - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data      
``` 
 - Note also that we can use the **(.)** symbol to define the current working directory in the **volumes** section

---

## Compose file structure (3)
 - Every single key value option that can be used in the `docker-compose.yml` file is described on the [documentation page](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/) 
 - The default compose file name is `docker-compose.yml`, in this case we do not need to specify the yml file when we execute the `docker-compose` cli commands, e.g:

 ```console
 # docker-compose up
 ```
 - Use `-f` to specify the name and path of a custom yml compose file, e.g:
 ```console
 # docker-compose -f docker-compose-custom.yml up
 ```
