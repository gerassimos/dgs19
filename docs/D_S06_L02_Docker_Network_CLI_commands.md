# Section 6 - Docker Networking Basics
## 2 - Docker Network CLI commands

---

## Objectives
 - Practice the commands for controlling docker networks

---
## Commands overview
- Show networks - `docker network ls`
- Inspect a network - `docker network inspect`
- Create a network - `docker network create --driver`
- Connect a container to a network - `docker network connect`
- Disconnect a container from a network - `docker network disconnect`
---


## Example 
- We will create a nginx container "web_server" to use it as a reference for this lecture.
 
```terminal
docker container run --publish 80:80 --name web_server -d nginx
```

---

## docker network ls
 - Use `docker network ls` command to list all networks that have been created on a Docker host
 ```terminal
# docker network ls
NETWORK ID          NAME       DRIVER     SCOPE
31b82a12c304        bridge     bridge     local
b0897e090893        host       host       local
3163420f3967        none       null       local
```
> Note: 
> - Remember that sometime the `bridge` network is called `docker0`.
> - If we do not specify any network when we create a container, then the default `bridge` network is used.
> - The `bridge` (docker0) network is using the `bridge` driver.
> - The `bridge` driver is the default network driver when => container on a bridge network go through the NAT firewall to the physical  network.

---

## docker network inspect
- Use  `docker network inspect` to display detailed information of a network. 

```terminal
docker network inspect bridge
    {
        "Name": "bridge", ...
        "Subnet": "172.17.0.0/16",   
        "Gateway": "172.17.0.1" ...
        "Containers": {
            "e67416da3c6306e5353f3579827ec98dd2800c1514c6f778525f6a391b2c79f7": {
                "Name": "web_server",
                "EndpointID": "20f643a0412a83f624e0395f7ff7516d8535252376c189e64fa8098cf7696cad",
                "MacAddress": "02:42:ac:11:00:02",
                "IPv4Address": "172.17.0.2/16", ...
```
> - We can see also the "Subnet": "172.17.0.0/16" and the default "Gateway": "172.17.0.1" use to route out to the physical network.
> - In the "Containers" section we can see that there is a container "web_server" connected to this network and that the IP address is "172.17.0.2/16" . 

---


## Network driver - host (example) (1)
- The host network `--network host` is a special network that skips the virtual networking of Docker and attaches the container directly to the **host interface**.
- If you use the host network driver for a container, that container’s network stack is **not isolated** from the Docker host. 
- In this case, there **NO protection** from the NAT firewall that seats in the front of the virtual networks.
- For instance, if you run a container which binds to port 80 and you use host networking, the container’s application will be available on port 80 on the host’s IP address.
- There is **better network performance**, since there are not any virtual layers present. 
- There are special applications that require access to the physical network interface. 

---

## Network driver - host (example) (2)
 - Create a container with network `host` driver.

```terminal
# docker container run --network host --name web_server_2 -d nginx
```

> Note: 
> In this example nginx will open port 80 on the physical network interface of the Docker host..
> If port 80 on the Docker host is already occupied, then the nginx container will not be successfully started. 

---

## Network driver - none  (example)
- If you want to completely disable the networking stack on a container, you can use the `--network none` flag when starting the container. Within the container only the loopback device is created. The following example illustrates this.

```terminal
# docker container run --network none  alpine  ip a
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN qlen 1
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```  

> Notice that no eth0 is created.

---

## docker network create
 - create a user-defined bridge network 

```terminal
# docker network create my_app_net
8b3050f27566f4f4e5bb01136e81fddef1b4516b5bb143d7e2f412b33c3f5b7e

# docker network ls
NETWORK ID          NAME          DRIVER      SCOPE
31b82a12c304        bridge        bridge      local
b0897e090893        host          host        local
8b3050f27566        my_app_net    bridge      local
3163420f3967        none          null        local
```  

> Note: 
> The new network is created with a driver of bridge because this is the default driver.

---

## docker network create (2)
 -  The next available subnet is automatically assigned to the new user-defined bridge network. 

```terminal
$ docker network inspect my_app_net
...
   "Subnet": "172.18.0.0/16",
...
```
> Note: 
>  - The "172.18.0.0/16" subnet is created and the default one is "172.17.0.0/16" 
>  - All these settings can be changed 

---

## docker network create (3)
 -  create a  user-defined network with specific driver

```terminal
# docker network create --driver bridge my-bridge-network
```

 - The `--driver` option accepts `bridge` or `overlay` which are the built-in network drivers
 - If we have installed a third party network driver, you can specify that DRIVER here also (like Weave).

---

## docker network create (4) 
 - create a user-defined network with specific options

```terminal
# docker network create --help

Options:
      --attachable           Enable manual container attachment
 ...
  -d, --driver string        Driver to manage the Network (default "bridge")
      --gateway strings      IPv4 or IPv6 Gateway for the master subnet
      --ingress              Create swarm routing-mesh network
      --internal             Restrict external access to the network
      --ip-range strings     Allocate container ip from a sub-range
      --ipam-driver string   IP Address Management Driver (default "default")
      --ipam-opt map         Set IPAM driver specific options (default map[])
      --ipv6                 Enable IPv6 networking
      --label list           Set metadata on a network

```
> From the CLI documentation we can view all possible options that can be used for more advanced scenarios.

---

## Connect a container to a user-defined network (1)
 - We can use the `--network` option to connect a container to a user-defined network.

```terminal
# docker container run -d --name new_nginx --network my_app_net nginx
```

---

## Connect a container to a user-defined network (2)
 - Verify that the new_nginx container is connected to the `my_app_net` network.

```terminal
# docker network inspect my_app_net
[
 ...
        "Containers": {
            "c1442972be77395c41f86a42d358814816be8a1ce2436bb56a804abdb3ea8e05": {
                "Name": "new_nginx",
                "EndpointID": "66287cf5d53fc15bc25c7647993b545d92db6673b8f4c3dc48c05d6c46f5c9e8",
                "MacAddress": "02:42:ac:12:00:02",
                "IPv4Address": "172.18.0.2/16",
                "IPv6Address": ""
            }
        },
...
```

> Note:  
> The IP address of the new_nginx container is "172.18.0.2"

---

## Connect/Disconnect a container to a user-defined network
 - We don't have to start new containers, just like with the physical network where we can unplug and re-plug in Ethernet devices, we can also do the same with existing networks and existing containers.
 - When we connect a container to a new network, then a new NIC is dynamically created

---

## docker network connect (1)
 - Use `docker network connect` to connect a container to a network.
 - We can connect a container by name or by ID. Once connected, the container can communicate with other containers in the same network.

---

## docker network connect (2)

```terminal
# docker network connect my_app_net web_server
# docker container inspect web_server
[
    {
        "Id": "080b0a6e30ced4745d73a95324e5ba74183ef49462ef0cc69a6b5b46b9264005", ...
            "Networks": {
                "bridge": { ...
                    "Gateway": "172.17.0.1",
                    "IPAddress": "172.17.0.2",
                    "IPPrefixLen": 16, ...
                },
                "my_app_net": { ...
                    "Gateway": "172.18.0.1",
                    "IPAddress": "172.18.0.3", ...
```

> Notes: 
> We can see that the "web_server" container has two IP addresses **172.17.0.2** and **172.18.0.3** related to the two different virtual networks that the container is connected to (bridge and my_app_net).

---

## docker network disconnect
- Use the `docker network disconnect` command to disconnect a container from a network.

```terminal
# docker network disconnect my_app_net web_server
# docker container inspect web_server
...
```

---

## Docker Networks: Default Security
 - In the physical world where we create virtual machines and hosts in a network, we often overexpose the ports and networking on our application servers.  
 - With Docker `bridge` virtual network, you only expose the ports on a host for which you specifically use  the `--publish` option.
